    "To capture recency effects, BKT can be extended to allow skill forgetting. Forgetting corresponds to fitting a BKT parameter $F ≡ P(K_{s,i+1} = 0 | K_{si} = 1)$, the probability of transitioning from a state of knowing to not knowing a skill. In standard BKT, $F = 0$. Without forgetting, once BKT infers that the student has learned, even a long run of poorly performing trials cannot alter the inferred knowledge state. However, with forgetting, the knowledge state can transition in either direction, which allows the model to be more sensitive to the recent trials: a run of unsuccessful trials is indicative of not knowing the skill. \n",
    "\n",
    "Forgetting is not a new idea to BKT, and in fact was included in the original psychological theory that underlies the notion of binary knowledge state. However, it has not typically been incorporated into BKT. When it has been included in BKT, the motivation was to model forgetting from one day to the next, not forgetting that can occur on a much shorter time scale. Incorporating forgetting can not only sensitize BKT to recent events but can also contextualize trial sequences. Using forgetting, BKT can readily incorporate some information about the absolute trial sequence, and therefore has more potential than classic BKT to be sensitive to interspersed trials in the exercise sequence.

Dataset usage follows a common pattern: (i) create a source dataset from your input data, (ii) apply dataset transformations to preprocess the data, (iii) iterate over the dataset and process the elements. Iteration happens in a streaming fashion, so the full dataset does not need to fit into memory."
