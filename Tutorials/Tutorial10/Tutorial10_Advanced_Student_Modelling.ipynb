    "To capture recency effects, BKT can be extended to allow skill forgetting. Forgetting corresponds to fitting a BKT parameter $F ≡ P(K_{s,i+1} = 0 | K_{si} = 1)$, the probability of transitioning from a state of knowing to not knowing a skill. In standard BKT, $F = 0$. Without forgetting, once BKT infers that the student has learned, even a long run of poorly performing trials cannot alter the inferred knowledge state. However, with forgetting, the knowledge state can transition in either direction, which allows the model to be more sensitive to the recent trials: a run of unsuccessful trials is indicative of not knowing the skill. \n",
    "\n",
    "Forgetting is not a new idea to BKT, and in fact was included in the original psychological theory that underlies the notion of binary knowledge state. However, it has not typically been incorporated into BKT. When it has been included in BKT, the motivation was to model forgetting from one day to the next, not forgetting that can occur on a much shorter time scale. Incorporating forgetting can not only sensitize BKT to recent events but can also contextualize trial sequences. Using forgetting, BKT can readily incorporate some information about the absolute trial sequence, and therefore has more potential than classic BKT to be sensitive to interspersed trials in the exercise sequence.

It is a task to model students' mastery level of a skill based on their historical learning trajectories. In recent years, a recurrent neural network model called deep knowledge tracing (DKT) has been proposed to handle the knowledge tracing task and literature has shown that DKT generally outperforms traditional methods.\n",

    "As presented in the lecture, a DKT model is characterized by the following main three components:\n",
    "- **Input**: the one-hot encoded observations at varying time steps. \n",
    "- **Network**: a recurrent neural network that processes the one-hot encoded observations in a time-wise manner. \n",
    "- **Output**: the probabilities for answering skill (or item) correct at the varying time steps.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The first step to enable a DKT experimental pipeline requires to prepare the input and output data to be fed into the model during the training and evaluation phases. TensorFlow has an API, called [TF Dataset](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data/Dataset), that supports writing descriptive and efficient input pipelines. Dataset usage follows a common pattern: (i) create a source dataset from your input data, (ii) apply dataset transformations to preprocess the data, (iii) iterate over the dataset and process the elements. Iteration happens in a streaming fashion, so the full dataset does not need to fit into memory."

Particular focus was given to the discussion and interpretation of the results across kills and data sets. "
