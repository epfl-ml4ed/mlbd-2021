    "The preceding discussion is meant to give you some intuition into the trade-off between bias and variance, and its dependence on model complexity. In practice, models generally have more than one hyper-parameter to turn, and thus plots of validation plots change from lines to multi-dimensional surfaces. In these cases, such visualizations are difficult and we would rather simply find the particular model that maximizes the validation score.\n",

We will explore a three-dimensional grid of model features; namely the number of estimators, the criterion, and the maximum number of features, for didactic purposes. This can be set up using Scikit-Learn's GridSearchCV meta-estimator. \n",
