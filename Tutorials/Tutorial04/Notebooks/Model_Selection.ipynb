In practice, models generally have more than one hyper-parameter to turn, and thus plots of validation plots change from lines to multi-dimensional surfaces. In these cases, such visualizations are difficult and we would rather simply find the particular model that maximizes the validation score.\n",

This can be set up using Scikit-Learn's GridSearchCV meta-estimator. \n",
