    "One notable application of machine learning in education is represented **knowledge inference models**, which aim to understand how well a student is learning concepts or skills. Being able to monitor this knowledge makes it possible to improve and personalize online learning platforms or intelligent tutoring systems, by focusing on areas the student is weak in and accelerating learning of certain concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we study a range of popular models for modelling students' knowledge based on **Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT)**. BKT was introduced in 1995 as a means to model students' knowledge as a **latent variable** in online learning environments. Specifically, the environment can maintain an estimate of the **probability that the student has learned a set of skills**, which is statistically equivalent to a 2-node dynamic Bayesian network. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this tutorial, we will rely on a Python implementation of the Bayesian Knowledge Tracing algorithm and more recent variants, estimating student cognitive mastery from problem solving sequences, known under the name of **pyBKT**. This package can be used to define and fit many BKT variants. \n",
    "\n",
    "These variants are derived from a range of papers published in the educational data mining literature and, in this tutorial, we will provide you with the main notions and implementation details needed to investigate BKT models in practice.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Tasks**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Follow the pyBKT getting started showcase.\n",
    "- Solve a range of exercises on BKT models. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Objectives**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Instantiate and run a pipeline on BKT models. \n",
    "- Conduct fine-grained analyses on specific learning skills. \n",
    "- Understand and experiment with different variants of BKT.\n",
    "- Compare the performance of BKT setups under different evaluation methods. \n",
    "- Inspect the influence of a BKT variant on the internal BKT parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "More information on the PyBKT is provided in the corresponding [Github repository](https://github.com/CAHLR/pyBKT). "

    "## Introduction\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "BKT models operationalize the learning of a student as a **Markov process**, building upon the idea that, while students interact with an educational environment, their skill in a given concept improves. To move the theory behind BKT into practice, variables related to forgetting, learning, guessing, slipping, and so on need to be modelled, controlling for instance how fast and how well learning is happening for the student. \n",
    "\n",
    "The BKT model assumes that the student’s knowledge can be estimated by means of standardized questions, which can be answered correctly or incorrectly, on a concept or combination of concepts. BKT also assumes that initially a student may not know about a concept, but their knowledge gets better with learning and practice related to that concept. Since it is modelled as a Markov process, we have **transition probabilities** across different **states of the process**, specifically: \n",
    "\n",
    "- $P_0$ is the initial probability of answering the question correct. \n",
    "- $P_{\\text{F}}$ is the probability that the student forgot something previously learned. \n",
    "- $P_{\\text{L}}$ is the probability that the student has learned something that was previous not known. \n",
    "- $P_{\\text{S}}$ is the probability that the student gave a wrong answer even though they had learned the concept.\n",
    "- $P_{\\text{G}}$ is the probability that the student guessed the right answer while not knowing the concept. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will use a dataset of the student’s responses to questions in a test, along with whether they answered correctly or incorrectly, and we will use a BKT model to find the values of the above probabilities."

Once they get an assignment, students can complete it at their own pace and with the help of hints, multiple chances, and immediate feedback.

Please, find more information on the platform [here](https://www.commonsense.org/education/website/assistments). \n",

    "In this tutorial, we have seen several important aspects of Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT). We have shown how a typical data set for knowledge tracing should look like. We have illustrated how BKT models can be trained on different skills. We have shown how different variants of BKT can help you improve the goodness of your model. Many of the ideas described in this tutorial can be adapted to other data sets and projects. Finally, we have shown some examples of predictions and evaluations, covering also cross-validation. If you are interested in the implementation details of the different variants, we invite you to explore the codebase stored in the pyBKT Github repository. "
