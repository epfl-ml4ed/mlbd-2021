    "\n",
    "$ŷ = w[0] * x[0] + w[1] * x[1] + ... + w[p] * x[p] + b > 0$\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula looks very similar to the one for linear regression, but instead of just returning the weighted sum of the features, we threshold the predicted value at zero. For linear models for classification, the decision boundary is a linear function of the input, that is a binary linear classifier is a classifier that separates two classes using a line, a plane, or a hyperplane. \n",
    "\n",
    "The linear classification algorithms we will cover in this tutorial are:\n",
    "- Logistic Regression\n",
    "- Linear Support Vector Machine\n",
    "\n",
    "A common technique to extend a binary to a multiclass classification algorithm is the one-vs.-rest approach. In one-vs.-rest approach, a binary model is learned for each class that tries to separate that class from all of the other classes. To make a prediction, all binary classifiers are run on a test point. The classifier with the highest score on its single class prevails. \n",
    "\n",
    "A few considerations on linear models:\n",
    "- One of the main parameters of linear models is the regularization parameter, called **C** in LinearSVC and LogisticRegression. Tuning this parameter is quite important.\n",
    "- Another decision to make would be whether you want to use **L1 regularization** or **L2 regularization**. If you assume that only a few of your features are actually important, you could use L1. Otherwise, you should default to L2. L1 can also be useful if interpretability of the model is important. \n",
    "- These models should scale to **very large datasets** and work well with **sparse data**. In that case, you could investigate the solver='sag' in LogisticRegression and Ridge, which is faster than the default on large datasets. In lower-dimensional spaces, other models might yield better generalization performance.\n",
    "- One strength of linear models is that they make it **relatively easy to understand** how a prediction is made, using the formulas we saw earlier. \n",
