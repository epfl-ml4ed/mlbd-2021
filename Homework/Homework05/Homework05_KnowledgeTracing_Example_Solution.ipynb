    "#  Homework 05: Knowledge Tracing\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "During the last lectures and lab session, you have dealt into one notable application of machine learning in education, namely knowledge tracing. Machine-learning models optimized for this task aim to understand how well a student is learning a portfolio of skills. Monitoring this knowledge by means of automated models allows to personalize online learning platforms, focusing the assessment on skills the student is weak in and accelerating learning of certain skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this homework, you are asked to work on the ASSISTment data set presented in Tutorial 5 and to complete the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Compare three knowledge tracing models (BKT, AFM, PFA) in terms of AUC and RMSE.\n",
    "- Generate and discuss the learning curves for a BKT model on a specific set of skills. \n",
    "\n",
    "Please, note that the lectures and tutorials delivered in Week 5 and 6 are an important source of information (it is fine to re-use source code from tutorials) and that you can use the two python packages presented in those tutorials, namely [pyBKT](https://github.com/CAHLR/pyBKT) and [pyAFM](https://github.com/cmaclell/pyAFM/), to solve Homework 5. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Submission \n",
    "\n",
    "The homework is due **Friday Apr 16, 2021 23:59 CET**. The notebook must be pushed to your GitHub classroom repository. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you have any questions, please feel free to use the Q&A forum in Moodle. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Some Instructions \n",
    "\n",
    "1. You are allowed to use any built-in Python library. If you want to use an external library, you have to justify it. \n",
    "2. Make sure you use the data folder provided in the repository in **read-only** mode. \n",
    "3. Please write all your comments in English, and use meaningful variable names in your code. \n",
    "4. Your repo should have a single notebook (plus the required data files) in the master branch. \n",
    "5. Be sure to hand in a fully-run and evaluated notebook (check the rendered notebook on the GitHub website once you have pushed). \n",
    "6. Be sure to provide a textual description of your thoughts, assumptions, solutions, and explanations for your answers, when requested."

    "ASSISTments is a free tool for assigning and assessing math problems and homework. Teachers can select and assign problem sets. Once they get an assignment, students can complete it at their own pace and with the help of hints, multiple chances, and immediate feedback. Teachers get instant results broken down by individual student or for the whole class. More information on the platform can be found [here](https://www.commonsense.org/education/website/assistments). \n",

    "Given that the main objective of this homework section is to evaluate three student's knowledge tracing models under a `user-stratified 10-fold cross validation`, in this task, we ask you to complete the body of a function named `create_iterator`. This function should create an iterator object able to split student's interactions included in `data` in `10 folds` such that the same student does not appear in two different folds. To do so, you can appropriately initialize a scikit-learn's GroupKFold iterator with non-overlapping groups and returning the iterator, i.e., `model_selection.GroupKFold(...).split(...)`. \n",
    "\n",
    "For convenience, we present you an illustrative example assuming that (i) you have four data samples and that (ii) the first two data samples belong to group 0 and the last two data samples belong to group 2. The data samples associated with a group should not appear in multiple folds or, in other words, the data samples associated with a group should appear all in the same fold. Please, find below a way to use the scikit-learn's GroupKFold object to create folds that meet this property (here, we simulate this scenario by considering only a 2-fold creation strategy):\n",

    "From the left plot, it can be observed that the BKT model exhibited a higher AUC score (over 0.87) and a lower standard deviation of AUC score across folds (0.01) with respect to AFM and PFA models, indicating that the predictive power of the BKT model is higher and more stable across folds than the one of the other two models, when AUC is considered. Specifically, the average BKT AUC is 0.12-point higher (0.87 vs 0.75) the average PFA AUC and 0.18-point higher (0.87 vs 0.69) than the average AFM AUC. Comparing the latter two models between each other, PFA outperforms AFM in terms of average AUC (0.75 vs 0.69, 0.06-point higher), though the difference in AUC between PFA and AFM is smaller than the difference of both with BKT. Furthermore, PFA exhibited a smaller standard deviation across folds (0.027) with respect to AFM (0.04). It can be hence observed that including information on both prior success and failure (PFA) allows the model to perform better and have a more stable performance across folds, with respect to the case where only general information on the opportunities is considered (AFM).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, the right plot highlights that the BKT model performs better, on average, with respect to AFM and PFA in terms of RMSE, i.e., the RMSE score is lower for the BKT model (0.36). AFM and PFA were able to achieve an average RMSE score of 0.42 (0.06-point higher than BKT) and 0.405 (0.045-point higher than BKT) respectively, showing again how using more fine-grained information on the failure and success of a student can lead to better predictions, but not as much as BKT. The standard deviation in performance across folds is quite small for all three models. Specifically, while being already the top performer in terms of average RMSE, the BKT model exhibited also the lowest standard deviation (0.009). AFM and PFA showed slightly higher standard deviations (0.018 and 0.12), showing that their performance were less stable across folds for the former. In general, the lower the RMSE is, the lower the standard deviation of the model performance is too. This strengthen the good performance shown by BKT, especially.        \n",
    "\n",
    "Based on our results, we can generally observe that the characteristics and properties of the BKT model allow us to make better estimations of student’s skill mastery, compared to the two other considered models. One reason behind this finding might be that the skills at hand seem to meet well BKT assumptions, specifically that (i) knowledge can be divided into different skills, (ii) the definition of skills is accurate enough, (iii) each task corresponds to a single skill, and (iv) there is no connection between the skills (we should mention that there is no \"extensive\" connection, though for certain skills some interrelationships exist). For AFM and PFA ones, leveraging prior failure and success opportunities (PFA) and fed them into the model leads to good performance with respect to AFM, but not as much we can with BKT. One reason behind the performance differences across models (and a step for further improvement of all of them) might lie also on the fact that we considered only a basic BKT (no forgetting or other advanced modelling) and we have not tuned certain aspects (e.g., bounds and regularizations in PFA and AFM).

Once you BKT model is fitted, we ask you to create a dataframe named `predictions` with four columns `user_id`, `skill_name`, `y_true`, `y_pred_bkt`. This dataframe should include one row per interaction in `data`, where user_id is the id of the student associated with that interaction, skill_name is the name of the skill involved in that interaction, y_true is the student's performance on that interaction (1 if correct at the first attempt, 0 otherwise), and y_pred_bkt is the prediction made by the pre-trained BKT model for that interaction.  \n",

    "### Task 2.3 Please discuss all visualizations (learning curves and bar plots) obtained with the BKT model. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, we discuss each skill separately. Then, given that we are showing the same aspects for the three skills, we provide few more observations aimed at comparing the findings we obtained across the skills under consideration. \n",
    "\n",
    "- \"**Circle Graph**\". From the error rate in the ground-truth data (y_true, blue), it can be observed that this skill appears quite hard for students, with an initial error rate of around 0.60 in the first opportunity. The error rate goes slightly down, as we would usually expect, as much as the students play with the skill, reaching the lowest error rate of 0.38 at around 7 opportunities. However, starting from #opportunities around equal to 7, the error rate starts going up till 0.80 after 50 opportunities. It seems that a large part of the students managed to master a bit this skill in the first opportunities, but then they start facing difficulties in mastering it. This behavior might be due to the fact that the skill is ill-defined or that the problems become too difficult or are not aligned well with the skill.  After 50 opportunities, the error rate starts jumping between 0 and a 1 just because there are only few students. In terms of confidence interval (blue area), it can be observed that the error rate is quite stable at the earlier stage. Starting from around 7 opportunities, the error rate is less stable probably due to the same reasons we provided above. The confidence interval finally becomes large when only few students keep playing with this skill for a higher number of opportunities. When it comes to consider the error rate obtained by the BKT model estimations (y_pred_bkt, orange), it can be observed that the model tends to overestimate a bit the error rate during the first opportunities (the orange line is above the blue one, the model tends to predict more errors than expected), while the opposite pattern is observed for higher numbers of opportunities (the model tends to predict less errors than expected). However, in general, the model fits well the ground-truth data. Looking at the bar plot at the bottom, students appear reasonably engaged with this skill only for few opportunities (particularly, starting from 35 opportunities, the number of involved students is low, and the error rate starts jumping more).            \n",
    "\n",
    "- \"**Mode**\". Based on the patterns of the ground-truth data (y_true, blue), the error rate observed for this skill at the earlier stages is of around 0.20. The students thus are already good in problems involving this skill, somehow. While this might depend on the intrinsic knowledge/background of the students about this skill, this behavior might also appear due to the fact that the skill is easier and easier to master in general or that the problems presented to the students on that skill are too easy, for instance. While the error rate goes slightly down when the number of opportunities increases, the difference between the initial error rate and the error rate experienced (for instance) after 5 or 6 opportunities is relatively small (around 0.10 of error rate in the latter case). This observation might be justified by the fact that students played with the skill only for few opportunities (so there is no so much room for improving more) and by the already low initial error rate (students might use those opportunities just to refine their knowledge, with few errors still happening). The going-up behavior at the end appears mainly due to the very low number of students involved at that point. The blue area shows us that the confidence interval is very small for the first three or four opportunities (so behavior is more consistent among students), while it starts increasing later probably also due to the peculiar patterns behind students who interact more with this skill. The BKT model (y_pred_bkt, orange) is able to fit the ground-truth data very well across the number of opportunities, especially till around 8 opportunities. One important observation comes from the bar plot, which shows that the number of students involved in this skill drastically goes down especially after three/four opportunities.     \n",

    "- \"**Venn Diagram**\". This third skill appears like another somehow easy skill since the beginning (y_true, blue), but a bit more harder than \"Mode\". Except for a few fluctuations in the very first opportunities (where the curve slightly increases, maybe because they are just the first opportunities or due to the type/difficulty of problems proposed at that point), the error rate goes down till around 0.08, reached at around 100 opportunities. Probably, once only those students struggling more with this skill tend to stay for a higher number of opportunities, the error rate goes up again. The confidence interval for the ground-truth data (blue area) is relatively high (if compared with the one observed for the other two skills during the first opportunities). Naturally, it increases even more when the number of students reaching that number of opportunities is very low (#opportunities > 130). Comparing the ground-truth estimations with the BKT estimations (y_pred_bkt, orange), except for the first opportunities, it can be observed that BKT tends to consistently underestimate the error rate and the BKT error rate is often outside the confidence interval of actual data. The number of students per opportunity naturally goes down as observed for the other skills, but interestingly it can be observed that a set of students seems to still keep playing with this skill from around 30 opportunites till 100 opportunities stably (the bar plot values appear somehow similar in that range).  \n",

    "Overall, comparing the considered three skills, \"Circle Graph\" seems to be really going up (e.g., ill-defined skill or due to the type/difficulty of problems), while, for \"Mode\" and \"Venn Diagram\", the going up later seems to come only from the very low number of students. Especially but not only for the \"Venn Diagram\" skill, the BKT generally tends to under-estimate the error rate. One reason behind this observation could be that the BKT model we adopted did not consider forgetting, for instance. In terms of number of opportunities, students experienced a lower maximum number of opportunities on the \"Mode\" skill, compared to the others. Compared to \"Circle Graph\", the skill \"Venn Diagram\" seems to involve lots of students even for higher number of opportunities (e.g., #opportunities > 30).   "
