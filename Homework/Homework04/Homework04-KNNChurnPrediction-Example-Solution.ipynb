    "#  Homework 04: KNN for Churn Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This week, we will go more deeply into the churn prediction task introduced in the previous homework. As you already know, churn prediction is one of the most popular use cases of machine learning in business, consisting of detecting customers who are likely to cancel a subscription to a service. Churn can be triggered by better price offers, more interesting packages, bad service experiences or personal situation changes experienced by customers. To timely prevent customers' churn, companies might adopt a machine learning classifier able to predict churn on an individual customer basis, and then use the predictions of this classifier to know when countermeasures (e.g., discounts or special offers) against churn are needed, to prevent the churn event.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous homework, you were expected to use a range of demographic and basic contract-related features and create five additional behavioral as well as an appropriate evaluation method and performance metric(s) to assess the goodness of your classifier in predicting churn for customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this homework, we ask you again to work on the machine-learning pipeline presented at the end of lecture 4, by instantiating, exploring, and fine-tuning a series of k-Nearest-Neighbors (kNNs) classifiers. Specifically, we will ask you to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Experiment with distance matrices and KNN classifiers fed with only demographic features or only behavioral features.\n",
    "- Experiment with distance matrices and KNN classifiers fed with both demographic and behavioral features. \n",
    "- Report, visually, the performance of three fine-tuned KNN classifiers (demographic, tuned), (behavioral, tuned), and (combined, tuned), and discuss.\n",
    "\n",
    "The focus of this homework is on modelling and not on the quality of features. Therefore, note that there should be **no** need to perform any feature engineering in this homework. You are expected to re-use the features (and possibly a part of the source code) that you have created in homework 3. If you have not submitted homework 3, please do get in touch with the TAs, and they will provide five example behavioral feature to use in this homework.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Submission \n",
    "\n",
    "The homework is due **Mar 30, 2021 23:59 CET**. The notebook must be pushed to your GitHub classroom repository. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you have any questions, feel free to use the Q&A forum in Moodle. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Some Instructions \n",
    "\n",
    "1. You are allowed to use any built-in Python library. If you want to use an external library, you have to justify it. \n",
    "2. Make sure you use the data folder provided in the repository in **read-only** mode. \n",
    "3. Please write all your comments in English, and use meaningful variable names in your code. \n",
    "4. Your repo should have a single notebook (plus the required data files) in the master branch. \n",
    "5. Be sure to hand in a fully-run and evaluated notebook (check the rendered notebook on the GitHub website once you have pushed). \n",
    "6. Be sure to provide a textual description of your thoughts, assumptions, solutions, and explanations for your answers, when requested."

    "    As expected, the balanced accuracy scores are not really high because of the high imbalance in the dataset (27%/73%).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    With k=1, the predictions probabilities are very strong, and always equal to 0 or 1. This makes sense, as with one neighbour, the class of the instance is that of that neighbour fully. The balanced accuracy score (balacc) and the area under the receiver operator curve (ROC area) are therefore similar (no matter the thresholds, nothing will change, since each of the probabilities are either 0 or 1). Note that when k=1, the proportion of positive predictions is close to the proportion of positive instances.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    With k=25, the performances increase a little bit, both for the balacc and the ROC area. The predictions are also a bit more mitigated, as the amount of neighbours is higher too. Unfortunately, this also means that the churn class gets drowned by the inevitable large number of negative instances in the training set. This is reflected in the proportions of positive predictions, which reaches 13%, compared to 27% in our dataset.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Finally, with k=1000, almost all predictions become negative. Indeed, the amount of positive predictions is of 1869, versus 5174. The probability of churn-class instances being overpowered by the majority class instances with such a large number of neighbours is thus quite high.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    For all three numbers of neighbours, the standard deviation is really small. This is an indication that the method is rather robust to the fold of the data we've chosen.\n",

    "Given that the performance of KNNs is very sensitive to the choice of k (i.e., the number of neighbors), in this task, we ask you to fine-tune the KNN classifier over an appropriate `range of values for k`. To this end, you need to re-use and appropriately extend the implementation provided in Task 1.2 in order to make it possible to fine tune the hyper-parameter k of the kNN classifier. Please use the same method (`10-fold user-stratified cross-validation`) and performance metrics (`Balanced Accuracy` and `AUC`) as in task 1.2 to evaluate the classifier. Again, no plotting is needed, it is enough to print the scores in the cell."

To this end, in this task, we ask you to visually report the performance metrics of (i) the three kNN classifiers implemented in Task 1.2 and (ii) the fine-tuned kNN classifier obtained in Task 1.3. In other words, you should properly visualize the `Balanced Accuracy` and `AUC` scores achieved by the mentioned classifiers (computed in Task 1.2 and Task 1.3), so that the classifiers' performance can be easily compared.

    "    At a first glance, it seems like changing the number of neighbours generates a more significant difference for the balanced accuracy than for the AUC scores. With n=[25, 1000, fine tuned], all average AUC scores are within the first/third quartile of the others. The kNN classifiers with n=[1000, fine tuned] exhibited a higher average AUC score and a higher maximum score than the kNN classifier with n=25, though they also suffer from a larger variance. On the other side, in terms of balanced accuracy, it seems like there is a more significant difference between n=[1, 1000] and n=[25, fined tuned], as the means of n=1 and n=1000 are well outside the first quartile of the balanced accuracies of n=25 and the fine tuned knn. Specifically, the latter kNN classifiers (n=[25, fine tuned]) exhibited higher average balance accuracy scores. It can be also observed that, with n=fine tuned, the average balance accuracy score across folds is higher (and the variance in balance accuracy scores across folds is slightly lower) than the one achieved by the kNN classifier with 25 neighbors.   \n",
    "        \n",
    "    When the amount of neighbours equal to 1, the classifiers performs badly, no matter the metric used. This makes sense, as we can easily overfit, and no nuance is given to the class predicted (it's either 0 or 1). The latter also explains why the ROC AUC of the knn with n=1 is very low, while the others are at around 75 no matter the balanced accuracy score.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Speaking of, there seems to be a discrepancy between the balanced accuracy and the ROC AUC. This can be explained by the large imbalance in the dataset. Only 26% of the instances are from the minority class, which means that when a minority instance is predicted, it will statistically be surrounded by a certain amount of majority class instances when the number of neighbours is high. However, the prediction probabilities may be a bit lower than for majority instances, which means that were we to move the threshold from 0.5 for a lower value to predict our minority class, our algorithm may perform well, which is reflected in the roc AUC.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    All in all, it seems like 1 is too small to make meaningful predictions (overfitting and no nuance), while 1000 is way too many to detect our minority instances. This is reflected by the balanced accuracy, where both classifiers perform, on average, worse than the other two. 25 seems like it performs well, but the variance in performances is quite large for its balanced accuracy. However, on average, it performs the best on the balanced accuracy, and has a really high ROC AUC too. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Finetuning our algorithm, we notice that the optimal n belongs to [40, 299], with a high frequency of 199 being the optimal k. We then achieve results close to, or higher than the knn with n=25. None of them are very robust (their variance in balanced accuracy is rather large), but they both achieve high scores on the ROC AUC, with the fine tuned algorithm outperforming slightly the 25nn, and that with a small variance.\n",

    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, you should:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Prepare a feature matrix with only `behavioral features` for each customer (one row per customer, same behavioral features included in the phone_usage.csv, charges.csv, and/or services.csv files and that you created in the previous homework) and compute a `pair-wise distance matrix` across customers, by appropriately selecting (combining) one (or more if necessary) appropriate distance measure(s).  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Implement a kNN classifier with hyperparameter finetuning (i.e. finetune k over an appropriate range) and feed it with the created pairwise-distance matrix (the one that refers to only behavioral features). Evaluate the kNN classifier by using a `10-fold user-stratified cross-validation` and use `Balanced Accuracy` and `AUC` as performance metrics.\n",
    "  \n",
    "3. Create a pair-wise distance matrix by appropriately combining the pair-wise distance matrices you computed for only demographic features in Task 1.1 and only behavioral features in Task 2.1. Then, again prepare a finetuned kNN classifier and feed it with the combined distance matrix to predict churn. You are asked to again evaluate it using a `10-fold user-stratified cross-validation` and `Balanced Accuracy` and `AUC` as performance metrics.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Report visually `Balanced Accuracy` and `AUC` of (i) the fine-tuned kNN classifier obtained in Task 1.3 (demographic, fine-tuned), (ii) the fine-tuned kNN classifier obtained in Task 2.2 (behavioral, fine-tuned), and (iii) the fine-tuned kNN classifier obtained in Task 2.3 (demographic+behavioral, fine-tuned) in such a way that they can be easily and appropriately compared.

    "### Task 2.1\n",
    "\n",
    "As you might be observed, demographic features do not reveal how customers actually used the services, and adding behavioral features derived from the services the customers subscribed to, the extent to which they are charged monthly, and the actual phone usage, can help in improving the performance of our classifier. Therefore, in this task, we ask you to:\n",
    "- Compute a feature matrix `XB` with one row per customer and one column per **behavioral** feature (i.e., **the behavioral features that you created in homework 3**). The cell `XB[i,j]` represents the value of the behavioral feature `j` for customer `i`. The shape of the matrix `XB` should be (n_customers, n_behavioral_features). \n",
    "- Compute a pair-wise distance matrix `DB` with one row per customer and one column per customer. The cell `DB[i,j]` represents the pair-wise distance between the features vectors `XB[i]` and `XB[j]` of customer `i` and customer `j`, respectively. The shape of the matrix `DB` should be (n_customers, n_customers). Please make sure to choose an appropriate distance measure. \n",
    "\n",
    "One important point to be addressed here is that, depending on the different nature (e.g., numerical, categorical) of the behavioral features you created in the previous homework and you are expected to use here, selecting a single distance measure to create your pair-wise distance matrix might not be the right way to move forward. If the types of your behavioral features are very different, a more advanced strategy is needed. Specifically, you might need to use different distance measures for different subsets of your behavioral features. \n",
    "To support you with this, we provide a concrete example not related to this task for illustration. In this example, we assume that we have five features for a user: height (f1), abdomen circumference (f2), favorite three movies (f3,f4, and f5). Given these features, it is appropriate to use Euclidean distance for the vector [f1,f2] and use Jaccard distance for [f3,f4,f5]. To manage this situation, given a pair `(i, j)` of users, the following strategy can be used:\n",
    "- Compute the Euclidean distance for feature vectors [f1,f2] of users i and j - we assume to denote that by `t1[i,j]`. \n",
    "- Compute the Jaccard distance for [f3,f4,f5] of users i and j - we assume to denote that by `t2[i,j]`. \n",
    "- Compute the final distance as `DB[i,j] = t1[i,j] + t2[i,j]` (do not forget to check the scaling of t1 and t2). "

    "    For this question, we decided to take the same features we used in homework 3. Out of our 5 features, one is categorical: charging_length. We thus first turn the different possible categories into numerical ones for efficiency and simplicity, and then compute the hamming distance for that feature. This metric is particularly fitted to our problem, because of the non binary nature of our features, and the lack of meaning behind the labels chosen for the categories\n",
    "    \n",
    "    For the ordinal, numerical, other variables, we normalise the values between 0 and 1, such that all features have the same weight when computing our distance. In order to do so, we use a min max scaling strategy, after checking that our data does not contain outliers, which may compress the range of values too much and make us lose information. In order to then compute the distance measures for our continuous features, we choose the euclidean distances, as instances with similar features will be close in the euclidean space.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    We compute the final distance as being the euclidean distance * (4/5) + hamming distance * (1/5). We indeed normalise the distances by the amount of variables that were included to compute those distances. Using variable names rather than magic numbers will allow us to keep this function were we to decide to change our features, or add some more.\n",

To obtain this pair-wise distance matrix `D`, compute `D[i,j] = DD[i,j] + DB[i,j]`, for each `(i,j)` pair and do not forget to take into account the scaling of DD and DB.\n",

Again, you should use a `10-fold user-stratified cross-validation` and compute `Balanced Accuracy` and `AUC` for this setting. It is fine to just print the results in the cell."

    "    From the left plot above, it can be observed that the kNN classifier trained on demographic features only (blue box) exhibited a lower average balanced accuracy and a higher variance of balanced accuracy across folds with respect to the kNN classifier trained on behavioral features only (orange box), indicating that the predictive power instilled by behavioral features to kNN is higher and more stable across folds than the one instilled by demographic features to kNN, when balanced accuracy is considered. This is also confirmed by the minimum and maximum balanced accuracy scores achieved in the two settings, especially when we observe that the minimum score achieved by the kNN with demographic features is four percentage-points lower than the minimum score obtained by the kNN with behavioral features. Once we combine the two set of features (green box), the corresponding kNN classifier performs better on average and shows a lower variance in scores than the kNN classifiers trained on behavioural or demographic features separately in terms of balanced accuracy, though the first and third quartile of all three combinations largely overlap with each other across classifiers (especially between behavioral features only and full features). kNNs with behavioral features only and with the full features perform similarly in terms of minimum and maximum scores. \n",

    "    Compared to our first above observations, the above right plot highlights that the kNN classifier trained on demographic features only (blue box) performs better, on average, with respect to the kNN classifier trained on behavioral features only (orange box) in terms of AUC scores. They show a similar variance. Minimu and maximum AUC scores are slightly lower for the kNN classifier with behavioral features only. Finally, the kNN classifier trained on the combination of features (green box) and the kNN classifier trained on demographic features (blue box) have a very similar average AUC score across folds, and the average AUC score achieved by the kNN classifier trained on both feature sets is higher than the average AUC score achieved by the kNN classifier trained on behavioral features only. While the average AUC score between classifiers using demographic features only and both feature sets is really similar, again, it should be noted that the latter exhibited a lower variance across folds and a higher minimum score, indicating that it might be more robust to fold variance.\n",

    "    We observed that for all sets of features, the predictive power is not that high. Several components can explain this phenomena: \n",
    "    - There are so few minority instances than adding some features gets too confusing (curse of dimensionality), and does not help the algorithm (full).\n",
    "    - The way of aggregating distances does not work. Euclidean distances may be lower than the hamming distances. We may be giving too much weight to one feature type than the other (full).\n",
    "    - The way of normalising our values erases to much details (full-demographic-behavioural)\n",
    "    - This classification task is genuinely hard, no matter the set of features used (full-demographic-behavioural)\n",
